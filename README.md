If you are on a Rasberry Pi follow this tutorial to get OpenCV on the device.  You will need to follow [this](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/26/install-opencv-4-on-your-raspberry-pi/) tutorial and build Open CV from scratch option.  

Also I had to try 4 different cameras before I found one that works.
